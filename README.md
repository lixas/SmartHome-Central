Micropython + LVGL firmware for ESP32 PSRAM and 16MB flash boards added

# SmartHome-Central

My personal project to learn [Micropython](https://github.com/micropython/micropython) and by utilizing [LVGL](https://github.com/lvgl/lv_binding_micropython) on ILI9341 display

I could not do with just one ESP32 device (and avoid proxy and MQTT) I could not achieve BLE + HTTP + LVGL in one ESP32 generic device (no PSRAM chip). LVGL [does not play nice](https://github.com/lvgl/lv_binding_micropython/issues/109) together with BLE so I came up with idea to split into two devices- [Proxy](https://github.com/lixas/SmartHome-Central) and Central.

As main thermometers, capable of advertising data via BLE I've used cheap (4â‚¬) Xiaomi Thermometer [LYWSD03MMC](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000427410383.html)  with [custom firmware](https://github.com/atc1441/ATC_MiThermometer)

It uses OpenWeatherMap as weather data provider. To use your location, edit `sensor/weather.py` @115 request url
